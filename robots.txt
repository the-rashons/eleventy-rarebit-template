# The robots.txt file
#################################
#  
# Robots are programs that crawl a page to use its content in some other way.
# The most common reasons for this are search engines, who want to make the site
# searchable, and AI-Models, who use the Data as part of their training.
# 
# This file sets up rules stating which robots can and cannot crawl which parts
# of the site. However, this file is more of a sign, which simply asks robots to
# respect the rules. It cannot enforce them.
# 
# The basic syntax is simple: You start with a User-Agent,
# which specifies to which bot the following rules apply to.
# You can then set "Disallow" Directives, one per row.
# Lines that start with a '#' are ignored.
# 
# By default, this file excludes all Bots from crawling images (the ones in the
# "img"-folder) and excludes common AI models completely.
# Please note that preventing search engines from crawling the "/img" folder
# will also prevent them from finding the page via a reverse image search. 
# 
# You may adjust your preferences.
